### *Making Legal Documents Simple, Safe & Smart*

---

## 📌 Overview
**Samvidh.AI** is an AI-powered prototype created for the **Gen AI Hackathon** that simplifies how users interact with legal documents.
It provides an easy-to-use prototype in Google Colab that helps users understand, summarize, and detect risks in legal text.

**Capabilities:**
- Convert dense legal text into simple, actionable summaries.
- Highlight important clauses (liability, termination, jurisdiction, obligations).
- Provide human-readable explanations for the AI outputs.
- Offer a Google Colab–based UI for quick prototyping and demonstration.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Legal documents are often:
- **Complex** — filled with legal jargon and nested clauses.
- **Time-consuming** — require careful reading to avoid missing critical points.
- **Risky** — omissions or misunderstood clauses can lead to legal exposure.

**Samvidh.AI** addresses these pain points by giving users fast, explainable insights and safety checks for legal documents.

---

## 🚀 Features
1. **Colab Prototype UI:** Widget-based controls to upload/paste documents and trigger analysis.
2. **AI Document Processing:** Uses LLM calls (placeholders available) to summarize and extract clauses.
3. **Summarization:** Short, readable bullet-points summarizing the contract.
4. **Clause Extraction & Highlighting:** Identify clauses like indemnity, termination, payment terms, confidentiality.
5. **Safety Checks / Risk Alerts:** Flag suspicious or missing clauses and provide suggested actions.
6. **Explainability:** Human-readable rationale for each alert or summary point.

## 📂 Notebook Contents
The notebook `Samvidh_AI_prototype_Gen_AI_Hackathon.ipynb` includes:
- Title & branding cells (⚖️ Samvidh.AI).
- Prototype preview section and Colab UI widgets.
- Code cells for preprocessing, model calls (placeholders or integration), and result rendering.
- Example usage and demo inputs (if included).

## ⚡ How to Run (Google Colab)
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload a legal document (PDF text should be extracted to plain text first) or paste contract text in the input widget.
3. Run code cells sequentially (or use "Runtime > Run all").
4. Use UI controls to generate summary, view clause highlights, and inspect risk alerts.

**Notes:** The notebook may contain placeholders for API keys (LLM providers, 3rd-party OCR). Add your keys as environment variables or directly in secure input widgets in Colab.

## 🛠️ Example: How the Analysis Flow Works (High-level)
1. **Text ingestion** — load / paste text, optionally run simple OCR for PDFs.
2. **Preprocessing** — normalize linebreaks, remove excessive whitespace, split into sections.
3. **Clause detection** — run simple regex/keyword-based detection followed by LLM verification.
4. **Summarization** — call the LLM with prompts like: *\"Summarize the key obligations and risks in 5 bullets.\"*
5. **Safety scoring** — map detected clauses onto a risk taxonomy and return a score & explanation.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy
- **Important:** Do not upload sensitive or privileged legal documents to third-party APIs unless you understand and accept the data-sharing terms.
- For production, consider an **on-premise** or **private-cloud** deployment with strict access controls, encryption at rest/in transit, and audit logging.

---

## 🔮 Roadmap & Future Improvements
- Multi-language support (Hindi, Marathi, etc.).
- Prebuilt templates for common contracts (NDA, Employment, Lease, Services).
- Conversational Q&A interface for follow-up clarifications.
- Exportable reports (PDF) summarizing risks & recommended actions.
- Integration with secure storage / versioning for audit trails.
